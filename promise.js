// name spaceing to be an empty one.
// string manipulation. each celltheat links to something attractions. will have a class.


// One id from firebase and make sure it works.

/* Meg's comments
// use an overlay with a grid, each cell would have its own class name or id
// string manipulation: each cell that links to something (attractions), will have a class name
// add event listener to those classes, to call the function

// first part of function will be to know which cell was clicked
// second - ask firebase for the information, which is where the promise comes from
// third - return what firebase information was called, and display

// add separate class name to any cells that are empty, which would call to the default instructions id

// create an empty div


// TO TEST - create one id for the one map image, then break it out to the different cells
